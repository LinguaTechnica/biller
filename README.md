# Invoicify Client

Invoicify is an application that allows customers to manage business clients, and billing and invoicing services.

Users are given an account. There they can view all the companies they do business with as well as the billing and invoice history.

You may want to run the backend application with this, else you won't be able to login and view any data: https://github.com/gSchool/invoicify

## Setup

WIP

### Install Node

To run Angular you require node. Download and install it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

**Developers Only**
You may want to install Node Version Manager (NVM). Different applications can require different versions of node. This is optional but recommended (does NOT work with Windows so skip if thats your OS:

### Install Invoicify

It's a good idea to have the Angular CLI tool installed globally. Before you begin, see that you do: `npm install`

``` 
git clone this_repository
cd this_repository
npm install

# Run server and open browser
ng serve -o
```
